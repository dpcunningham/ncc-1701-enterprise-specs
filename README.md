# ncc-1701-enterprise-specs
NCC-1701: Specifications (via Repository Issues and Epics) for the Construction of the [USS Enterprise](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/enterprise).

Populates associated GitHub [project board](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards):  [`ncc-1701-enterprise-timeline`](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-specs/projects).

...which is upstream from:
- [`ncc-1701-enterprise-build`](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-code/projects): a "swim lane" GitHub project board depicting task assignments across available crew, using cards (containing issues & epics) from the code repository on the line below;
- [`ncc-1701-enterprise-code`](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-code): an associated GitHub "code" repository which holds issues and epics transferred from *this* "spec" repository -- according to the "build" timeline project board on the line above.

### Purpose

This fictional project is a benchmark for a _"leanest possible"_ workflow process tied as closely as possible to a developer's day-to-day toolset and workflow within the GitHub ecosystem, according to the following premises:

- Top-notch development talent is a very constrained resource.  
- Typical "top down" project management tools inflict a heavy toll on developer focus & energy due to forced mental context switching.  
- Organizations can avoid this unnecessary friction by adopting management practices which seek to leverage the existing toolsets already in use by experienced developers.  
- Flipping the typical project management process on its head provides welcome relief to busy developement teams, and can yield additional unanticipated benefits. 
- Finally, an understanding of the bigger "business landscape" around the BitHub ecosystem shows why using tools external to Github is (in the longer term) a non-viable approach

Details of this argument are provided in the associated [project wiki](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-specs/wiki/A-Lean-Project-Management-Workflow-Based-Entirely-Within-GitHub) (bulletin board), which demonstrates another valuable tool (i.e. organized knowledge collection) for project management in this lean workflow based entirely within GitHub.
